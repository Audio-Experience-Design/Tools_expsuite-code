%
% STIMPAR
% PREEMPFN: File name of the preemphasis matrix with hEMP and chEMP
% FN: Prefix of excitation signals:
%    - FN.wav will be loaded
%    - preemphasis filters will be applied
%    - all preemphisized filters will be normalized (scaled by SCALE)
%    - result will be saved as FN_CH.wav
%
% SCALE: scaling factor for normalisation (linear, not dB)
