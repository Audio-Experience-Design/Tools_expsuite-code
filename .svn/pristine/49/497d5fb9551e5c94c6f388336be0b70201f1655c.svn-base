% AA_CalcSaveFILT             - save hM data in a filter format
%
% ch=AA_CalcSaveFILT(hM, meta, fn)
% 
% AA_CalcSaveFILT saves the data in hM, stimPar and meta.pos in a format 
% which is used by AA_Equalize or AA_Filter. The filename fn is used
% to save the data. In fn, hM is saved as hFILT. The information about the
% audio channel is extracted from meta.pos and saved as chFILT. 
%
% Input:
%  hM: data matrix with impulse respnoses (IR): 
%      dim 1: time in samples
%      dim 2: each IR
%      dim 3: each record channel
%      hM is saved as hFILT in fn.
%  meta: hM structured meta data
%      The channel column is saved as chFILT in fn.
%  fn: file name of the filter file.  
%
% Output: 
%  CH: unique channels found in hM. Just for information...
