function meta=AA_CalcEnergy(hM, meta)

% AA_CalcEnergy               - calculate the energy of IR
%
% meta.pos=AA_CalcEnergy(hM, meta.pos)
% 
% AA_CalcEnergy calculates the energy of each IR and appends this
% information to meta.pos in two additional columns. 
% AA_CalcEnergy works with stereo record channels only.
%
% Input: 
%  hM: data matrix with impulse respnoses (IR): 
%      dim 1: time in samples
%      dim 2: each IR
%      dim 3: each record channel
%  meta.pos: matrix with position information of an IR
%          [azi ele channel azi' ele' lateral polar]
%
% Output:
%  meta.pos: matrix with additional informations
%          [azi ele channel azi' ele' lateral polar energy_left energy_right]
