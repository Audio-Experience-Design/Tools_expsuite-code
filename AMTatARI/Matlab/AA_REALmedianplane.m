function [p,ii]=AA_REALmedianplane(hM, meta, mode, sens)
% [p,idx]=AA_REALmedianplane(hM, meta, mode, sens);
% plot the positions which stand for the real median plane
% The positions are choosen upon on the mode:
% ITD: seek for IACC with the max. lag of SENS (0 samples per default)
% ILD: seek for ILD smaller SENS dB (1 dB per default)
%
% p: new meta.pos with new data in last columns
% idx: index of positions in the real median plane
% Last change: 05.10.2011 by Michael Mihocic, upgrade to structured meta
%  data hM version 2.0.0
