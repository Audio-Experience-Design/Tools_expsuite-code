function hMnew=AA_Window(hM, siglen, fadeout, fadein, offset)

% AA_Window                 - window data in time domain
%
% hMnew=AA_Window(hM, siglen, fadeout, fadein,offset)
% 
% AA_Window windows the data in hM using a rectangular window of length
% siglen. The window begins at offset. Additionally, the windowed result is 
% faded in (from begin to fadein) and out (from fadeout to the end). 
%
% Input:
%  hM: data matrix with impulse respnoses (IR):
%      dim 1: time in samples
%      dim 2: each IR
%      dim 3: each record channel
%  siglen: length of the window in samples
%  fadeout: length of the fade out (Hanning window) in samples
%  fadein: length of the fade in (Hanning window) in samples
%  offset: offset (or shift) of the window in samples. 
%
% Output: 
%  hMnew: windowed hM data
