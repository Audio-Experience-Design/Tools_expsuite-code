% AA_AppendIR             - append an IR to hM
%
% [hM,meta]=AA_AppendIR(hM,hMNEW,meta,aziNEW,eleNEW)
%
% Input: 
%  hM: data matrix with impulse resposes (IR): 
%  hMNEW: new IR to be appended. Must have the correct size!
%  meta: hM structured meta data
%  aziNEW: azimuth of the new IR
%  eleNEW: elevation of the new IR
