function [azi,ele]=hor2geo(lat,pol)
% HOR2GEO converts coordinates in horizontal polar format to geodetic ones
% Usage:  [azi,ele]=hor2geo(lat,pol)
% Input arguments:
%       lat:        lateral angle   (-90 <= lat <= 90)
%       pol:        polar angle     (-90 <= pol < 270)
% Output arguments:
%       azi:        azimuth angle   (  0 <= azi < 360)
%       ele:        elevation angle (-90 <= ele <= 90)
